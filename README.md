### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on "Fiday" an online education platform.

  - You can find the software running at fiday.io.
  - Freeday is an online education platform. It allows educators to take their business online with minimal risk involved.
  - Platform consists of robust video handling. AWS infrastructure is used for media distribution.

On going project:
  - "Document Analysis, chargrid approach for understanding 2d-structured documents" 
  - The research paper I am following, here is the [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08799). Must read it for better understanding. 
  - You can see my github repo [here](https://github.com/sciencefictionlab/chargrid-pytorch).
  - Check out my article - [Explaining Network Architecture of chargrid-pytorch](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/implementing-chargrid-network-architecture-cc21eb3d68f8)

I write on medium as well- you can check-out my articles [here](https://medium.com/@pandeypragati2112)
